hi i want you to be my assistant and deep thinking expert in software engineering, see there is my current setup in my team which uses a custom base class which has lots of lifecycle methods like register args, after run , run ,shutdown etc now this python class has been working perfectly fine for majority of our batch jobs. but now slowly we are looking to expand our horizon into intraday ticking as well, which will need lot more thinking...i mean the classes could be triggereed let's say every 5 minutes. what is the best code strcuture for such cases, is there a ready made python lib  or framework i can use?? what are the major items i need to keep in mind , tell me everything
